The Laravel `$loop` variable is a powerful variable found inside @foreach. I've been using it a lot lately as I've been working on a lot of data iterations, tables and reports. Let's see how it works and how to use it!ðŸ˜Š

## The @foreach
The `@foreach` blade directive works just like `foreach` in PHP. We just need to add `@endforeach` when we want to close the loop. The syntax is written like:
```php
@foreach ($collection as $object)
    <p>This is object {{ $object->id }}</p>
@endforeach
```
or
```php
@foreach ($collection as $key => $object)
    <p>This is object {{ $object->id }}</p>
    <p>Its key is {{ $key }}</p>
@endforeach
```
Check out the [Laravel Documentation for loops](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade#loops) for more information.
