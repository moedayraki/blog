The Laravel `$loop` variable is a powerful variable found inside @foreach. I've been using it a lot lately as I've been working on a lot of data iterations, tables and reports. Let's see how it works and how to use it!ðŸ˜Š

## The @foreach
The `@foreach` blade directive works just like `foreach` in PHP. We just need to add `@endforeach` when we want to close the loop. The syntax is written like:
```php
@foreach ($collection as $object)
    <p>This is object {{ $object->id }}</p>
@endforeach
```
or
```php
@foreach ($collection as $key => $object)
    <p>This is object {{ $object->id }}</p>
    <p>Its key is {{ $key }}</p>
@endforeach
```
Check out the [Laravel Documentation for loops](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade#loops) for more information.

## The $loop
Laravel has made it easier for developers to track their information inside the loop by providing the `$loop` variable.
Useful properties to use:
<table>
  <thead>
    <th>Property</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>$loop->index</td>        
      <td>The index of the current loop iteration (starts at 0).</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->iteration</td>        
      <td>The current loop iteration (starts at 1).</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->remaining</td>        
      <td>The iterations remaining in the loop.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->count</td>        
      <td>The total number of items in the array being iterated.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->first</td>        
      <td>Whether this is the first iteration through the loop.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->last</td>        
      <td>Whether this is the last iteration through the loop.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->even </td>        
      <td>Whether this is an even iteration through the loop.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->odd</td>        
      <td>Whether this is an odd iteration through the loop.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->depth</td>        
      <td>The nesting level of the current loop.</td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
      <td>$loop->parent</td>        
      <td>When in a nested loop, the parent's loop variable.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
The `$loop->parent` property have access to all the properties for the loop but for the parent.
