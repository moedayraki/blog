The Laravel `$loop` variable is a powerful variable found inside @foreach. I've been using it a lot lately as I've been working on a lot of data iterations, tables and reports. Let's see how it works and how to use it!ðŸ˜Š

## The @foreach
The `@foreach` blade directive works just like `foreach` in PHP. We just need to add `@endforeach` when we want to close the loop. The syntax is written like:
```php
@foreach ($collection as $object)
    <p>This is object {{ $object->id }}</p>
@endforeach
```
or
```php
@foreach ($collection as $key => $object)
    <p>This is object {{ $object->id }}</p>
    <p>Its key is {{ $key }}</p>
@endforeach
```
Check out the [Laravel Documentation for loops](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/blade#loops) for more information.

## The $loop
Laravel has made it easier for developers to track their information inside the loop by providing the `$loop` variable.
Useful properties to use:
|Property        |Description                                             |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
|$loop->index    |	The index of the current loop iteration (starts at 0).|
|$loop->iteration|	The current loop iteration (starts at 1).             |
|$loop->remaining|	The iterations remaining in the loop.                 |
|$loop->count    |	The total number of items in the array being iterated.|
|$loop->first    |	Whether this is the first iteration through the loop. |
|$loop->last     |	Whether this is the last iteration through the loop.  |
|$loop->even     |	Whether this is an even iteration through the loop.   |
|$loop->odd      |	Whether this is an odd iteration through the loop.    |
|$loop->depth    |	The nesting level of the current loop.                |
|$loop->parent   |	When in a nested loop, the parent's loop variable.    |

The `$loop->parent` property have access to all the properties for the loop but for the parent.
