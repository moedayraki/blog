## AirPods Pro (2nd)

### What's New?

Apple's AirPods Pro (2nd gen) now has a new chip U1 within the charging case and this will make it trackable through the 'Find My' app. A speaker has been embedded on the side of the case to produce sound when in lost mode.

## Apple Watch Ultra

The Apple Watch Ultra is the most rugged and capable watch Apple has designed. It has a titanium case, precision dual-frequency GPS, up to 36 hours of battery life and cellular. The case itself is 49mm and is water resistant down to 100m. It has been tested on MIL-STD 810H and is IP6X dust-resistant.

An additional action button has been added to the side of the watch. It's customizable
and can do things like control a workout, mark a Compass Waypoint or begin a dive.
The apple watch has an additional speaker for louder sound and a siren speaker that
emits an 86-decibel sound pattern to attract help (can be heard up to 180 meters
away). On low power mode, the apple watch battery will last up to 60 hours.

## Apple Watch 8

The Apple Watch Series 8 features an all-new temperature sensor for deeper insights into women's health. This sensor might be updated in the future to track fever and temperature-related health problems. The Apple Watch is also introducing the Crash Detection feature.
