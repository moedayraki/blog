In Laravel, the setTouchedRelations() method in the Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model class offers a powerful way to specify which relationships should be marked as "touched" when saving a model. By using this method, you can effortlessly update the updated_at timestamp of related models along with the main model. In this article, we will explore the details of the setTouchedRelations() method and its practical usage scenarios.

## Updating Related Models on Save 
```php 
class User extends Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model
{ 
  public function posts() { 
    return $this->hasMany(Post::class); 
  } 
}

$user = User::find(1); $user->setTouchedRelations(['posts']); $user->save();
```
In this example, we retrieve a `User` model instance with an ID of 1. By calling the `setTouchedRelations()` method and passing in`['posts']`, we specify that the `posts` relationship should be marked as "touched" when saving the user model. As a result, when we call the `save()` method on the user model, the` updated_attimestamp` of the related `Post` models will also be updated.

## Updating Multiple Related Models
```php
class User extends Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model 
{ 
  public function posts() {
     return $this->hasMany(Post::class); 
  }
  public function comments()
  {
      return $this->hasMany(Comment::class);
  }
}

$user = User::find(1); $user->setTouchedRelations(['posts', 'comments']); $user->save();
```
In this example, we extend the previous example by including the `comments` relationship in the `setTouchedRelations()` method. By passing in `['posts', 'comments']`, we ensure that both the `posts` and `comments` relationships are marked as "touched" when saving the user model. Consequently, the `updated_at` timestamps of the related `Post` and `Comment` models will be updated accordingly.

## Let's Remember
The `setTouchedRelations()` method in Laravel's `Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model` class provides a convenient way to update the timestamps of related models when saving a model. By leveraging this method, you can effortlessly ensure data consistency and track the last time a relationship was updated. Whether you need to update a single related model or multiple related models, the `setTouchedRelations()` method offers a flexible solution. Give it a try and simplify your code while keeping your data up to date!

and voila!
Happy coding!
