Instead of talking about the best programming language to learn so, you can be rich, we're going to dive into the real deal and talk about the roadmap of the programming languages, the good ones, bad ones, loved and hated ones, famous and unknown ones.

## Easy to Learn Languages

### Scratch

Scratch is one of the programming languages you want to try if you know nothing about programming and want an easy start. It's a high-level visual language based on blocks developed in 2003 at MIT. block-based programming languages use drag and drop methods to represent bricks of code including variables, control flow, and operators.

### Basic

## Open Source
