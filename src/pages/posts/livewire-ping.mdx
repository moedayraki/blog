Livewire component that checks the ping every 1 second after the user clicks the
button. It's simple and only takes a few minutes to add.

We; the developers depend on our browsers, IDEs, and frameworks' dev tools to help us debug and fix the issues we face during our development process. However, these tools don't always get us what we're looking for and thus we need to create our own sometimes.

---

## Problem

Browser dev tools include the time taken for a request to be completed. The problem though is that they don't provide a ping check for the developer to watch their ping while developing as most video games do.

So, is there a way for us to watch the ping to our server while working on our web app? Can we do that without manually sending a request and looking at the time column in the browser's dev tools?

---

## Solution

With Livewire and its server-side rendering, we're going to create our own 'Ping' component that will automate the ping process for us.

### Create a component

To begin with, we're going to create a new Livewire component by calling the following command in our terminal.

```shell
php artisan make:livewire counter
```

This will create 2 files for us. One is the component itself **/app/Http/Livewire/Ping.php** and the other is the view **/resources/views/livewire/ping.blade.php**.

### Include the component

The next thing we need to do is include the component in our page.

By navigating to the page and adding `<livewire:ping />` where we want, a ping component will be displayed.

```html
<html>
  <head>
    ... @livewireStyles
  </head>
  <body>
    @livewireScripts
    <livewire:ping />
  </body>
</html>
```

### Add the functionality

Having the component displayed, now we're ready to add the functionality.

As a quick definition, a **ping** is a request/response cycle that checks if the server is up and at the same time calculates the time needed for a request to be completed.

In livewire, there are 4 steps to complete a ping.

![Livewire Cycle](~/assets/livewire-ping/livewire_cycle.jpg)

So let's start with the first step.

##### 1. Request from Client

Open the ping.blade.php file and add the following code.

```php
<div>
  <button wire:click="$toggle('show')">{{ $show ? 'Stop Ping' : 'Ping' }}</button>
    @if ($show)
        <div wire:poll.1000ms="getPing">{{ $ping }}</div>
    @endif
</div>
```

In the above code, the button has a `wire:click` attribute which triggers a **Livewire** event on click. The event wired is `$toggle('show')`. The `$toggle(property)` is a magic action that toggles boolean properties on or off. In this case, we're toggling the `show` property.

Under the button, we have a `div` shown only when the `show` property is true. The `wire:poll.1000ms` attribute is used to trigger a **Livewire** event every 1 second. The event wired is `getPing`. In the div, we're also showing the `ping` value.

  {" "}
  Note: Polling for changes over Ajax is a lightweight, simpler alternative to something
  like Laravel Echo, Pusher, or any WebSocket strategy.
</i>

##### 2. Reponse from Server

Now, we open `Ping.php` and add the following code.

```php
public $show = false;
public $ping = 'Pinging...';

public function getPing()
  {
    return true;
  }
```

`show` is a boolean property used to toggle the visibility of the div that has a livewire poll and includes the ping value.

`$ping` is a variable that will be used later in the view to display the ping.

`getPing` is the function we're calling from the view and it returns true as a simple response.

After adding the above code, we're ready to test the request/response cycle. We can test it by clicking the button and seeing a 'Pinging...' value. If we check the Network dev tools, we'll be able to see the ping request is sent every 1 second.

This means it's working!

##### 3. Calculating the Time and Reporting to Server

To calculate the time difference between the request and the response, we store the time of the initial request and the time of the response then subtract them. This will be done in the `ping.blade.php` using **_Livewire_** javascript hooks.

By adding the following code,

```html
<script>
  document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
      var ping = new Date()
      var pong = new Date()
      Livewire.hook('message.sent', (message, component) => {
          if (message.updateQueue[0].payload.method == 'getPing')
              ping = new Date()

      });
      Livewire.hook('message.received', (message, component) => {
          if (message.updateQueue[0].payload.method == 'getPing') {
              pong = new Date()
              @this.ping = `${pong - ping} ms`
          }
      });
  })
</script>
```

`Livewire.hook('message.sent', (message, component) => {...})` is a **Livewire** event that is triggered when a message is sent to the server. In the above code, we're listening to the `message.sent` event and when the message is sent, we're checking if the message is a `getPing` message. If it is, we're storing the time of the request. Livewire sends some other events including toggling the `$show` property and updating the `$ping` property which we don't need to use in the hook.

`Livewire.hook('message.received)' (message, component) => {...})` is a **Livewire** event that is triggered when a message is received from the server. In the above code, we're listening to the `message.received` event and when the message is received, we're checking if the message is a `getPing` message. If it is, we're storing the time of the response.

##### 4. Rendering the view

Having the time of the request and the time of response, we can calculate the time difference which is basically the ping.

In the above `script` tag, we have the `@this.ping`. `@this` is the **Livewire** Javascript component instance.

<i>
  Note: Because Livewire has both a PHP AND a JavaScript portion, each component
  also has a JavaScript object. You can access this object using the special
  @this blade directive in your component's view.
</i>

'@this.ping = `${pong - ping} ms`' calculates the time difference between the request and the response and sets the `ping` property to the value.

---

## Conclusion

The `Ping.php` file is now complete and looks like this.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Livewire;

use Livewire\Component;

class Ping extends Component
{
    public $show = false;
    public $ping = 'Pinging...';

    public function getPing()
    {
        return true;
    }

    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.ping');
    }
}
```

The `ping.blade.php` should be like this.

```php
<div>
    <button wire:click="$toggle('show')">{{ $show ? 'Stop Ping' : 'Ping' }}</button>
    @if ($show)
        <div wire:poll.1000ms="getPing">{{ $ping }}</div>
    @endif
    <script>
        document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", () => {
            var ping = new Date()
            var pong = new Date()
            Livewire.hook('message.sent', (message, component) => {
                if (message.updateQueue[0].payload.method == 'getPing')
                    ping = new Date()

            });
            Livewire.hook('message.received', (message, component) => {
                if (message.updateQueue[0].payload.method == 'getPing') {
                    pong = new Date()
                    @this.ping = `${pong - ping} ms`
                }
            });
        })
    </script>
</div>
```

And that's it! Now we have a component that can be used to check the ping of our server so let's try it out.

Open the page in your browser and click the 'Ping' button.

![Testing Page](~/assets/livewire-ping/test.gif)

&#9989; &nbsp;'Ping' button changed to 'Stop Ping'

&#9989; &nbsp;Ping updating every 1 seconds

&#9989; &nbsp; Dev tools show 2 requests every 1 second 'one for getting the ping and the other for rending the view'

Woohoo! It works! Now it feels like I'm gaming and not coding.

## Discussion

Which **Livewire** features did we use today?

- `wire:click` <i>event</i> for triggering a Livewire event
- `$toggle('property')` <i>magic action</i> for toggling a Livewire property
- `wire:poll.1000ms="method"` <i>directive</i> for polling for changes over Ajax
- `Livewire.hook('message.sent', (message, component) => {...})` & `Livewire.hook('message.received',(message,component) => {...})` <i>javascript hooks</i> for listening to Livewire events

**Livewire** has a lot of other features that we didn't use today including validation, file uploads, flash messages, traits, and more.

### #Other usage

How can we make this component UI/UX friendly? Which CSS framework do we use?
Guess what? Now the component is in your hands to tinker and make it as beautiful as you want!

The 'Ping' component can always be edited to automate requests and responses where we can check for new updates without manually clicking buttons.

Happy coding!
